A demo project illustrating the basics of uploading files to a cloud bucket. 
I used <a href="https://uploadcare.com/">upload care</a> as the storage bucket.

### Uploading files
There are 2 ways to upload. 
1. directly from the client side using a `public key`
2. generating a signature key (that consists of a `secret key` with the `HMAC/SHA256` code applied and an expiry time) and sending this key to the client. This key will then be used in the form-data fields for authorizations. Check <a href="https://uploadcare.com/docs/security/secure-uploads/">here</a>

I used method 2 which is more secure for the website I'm intending to use on.
The signature key is to be passed like the following:

*UPLOADCARE_PUB_KEY: is the public key of the project. This can be found in the API KEYS section*
*By default, images stored will be deleted after 24 hours. To make them permanent, you have to send a header "store" and set it to "1" <a href="https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/#operation/baseUpload">Reference</a>*

The response will include the file's UUID which I will be storing in the database.

### Deleting files
Again, there are 2 ways:
1. By using the `secret key` directly and sending the uuid of the file in DELETE request
2. By generating a signature along with several other headers.

I used method 1 as it's simpler and safer as it will be done in the server side.
